## The Utopia of Antarctica Built with Artificial Intelligence

**Communication is one of the powers of language.** We have always had this vision that language creates bridges, links worlds, brings people together, but above all creates knowledge, realities, thought. The power of thinking is governed by the capacity to create first in language. 

For this reason, **Wittgenstein warned that the limits of language are the limits of thought**, being inseparable from each other.

Language in our Western tradition also has a magical power that brings us closer to the world of the gods, since the world, from creation, was made by God enunciating language and sentences that manifested matter.

In this sense, **speaking is not only creating, it is also thinking.**

## Language as Identity

Thus, as we construct language, we construct language. Language, from my point of view, is also understood as a bridge to the metaphysical, since language enunciates concepts that are not pointing to the phenomenal world, but quite the opposite, a world that is prior to ideas. 

From this link, humanity has dared to think metaphysical concepts, and immaterial planes of knowledge.

Thus, **language is also identity.** We are the power of the narration that we can create through objects, people, communities and nations, and from these narratives we create and think the construction of something in common. It is an invisible but conceptual space to which we are linked.

## The New Colonization

In this way, since language is a tool of identity, **a simple way to colonize thought is through language**, both languages, and thought structures, syntax, meanings and signifiers that lead us to modify the conception of what we perceive as real both individually and collectively.

In this sense, many have been the indigenous struggles that different natives have had for which colonization processes have been declared not only cultural but also linguistic, which has led them to suffer crises not only ritual and cosmogonic, since the second language does not support the ancestral cosmogonic universe, but also personal.

## AI and Linguistic Unification

In this sense, **Artificial Intelligence**, which is based on constructs of language and thought, helps and facilitates many daily tasks to optimize processes, but also numbs a part of the brain that stimulates us to an individual language, since each person is unique, so too is their language.

It unifies us through a single reading, a single unit, which resembles a **Babylon unified by a Technological Tower** that leads us to think in a single language, which is the one offered by the different language models that the big tech companies offer.

In this sense, large companies exercise a colonization, which is no longer territorial, less symbolic, but **completely addresses the structure of what we are**, of the language we use to self-create ourselves and then think about the world under the reflection of our conceptual constructions.

It is thus, an applauded colonization, which undoubtedly threatens something more powerful than the slowness of the processes on which we create commerce.
