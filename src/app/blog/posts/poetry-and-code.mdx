## The Aesthetic Connection

In the 2001 documentary *The Code* by director Hannu Puttonen, Alan Cox, a key programmer in the development of Linux, expresses this relationship between code and poetry as follows:

> "Code has many similarities with poetry, for example, or with certain types of literature. Its beauty lies in its structure and in the fact of classifying ideas one by one, clearly. If the code is good, you can read it without needing comments. You immediately understand why it was written and how elegant it is. You'll look for code that is both elegant and clear, but that doesn't rely on programming tricks, that doesn't assume hypotheses that in the future could prove false, because the last thing you want is too much code. In the final kernel, the code doesn't need too much effort to work, because our goal is not to program and reprogram forever."

## Why I Entered the World of Computing

One of the reasons I decided to delve into the world of computing was because of this aesthetic link between computer code and poetry. I couldn't help but glimpse in coding a beautifully structured language, from the rules that, in computer coding, have been called best practices and clean code.

From a literary point of view, **poetry is the crown of a language**, whose power lies in simplicity, fluidity, and ease, accompanied by the power of its effect or the complexity of its depth.

From a computing point of view, **perfectly achieved code is nothing more than the elaboration of a perfectly achieved poem**, whose purpose, for those who understand it, is an aesthetic experience of its simplicity, its reduction in code, and, of course, its functional complexity.

## Poetry and Mathematics

For now, I share another relationship, which also lies in the beauty of simplicity and pristine expression: mathematics and poetry.
