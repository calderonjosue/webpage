## Overview

Ánphora.co was initially conceived as a Colombian **HealthTech** focused on wellness and skincare. Through market discovery, it was validated that demand was insufficient, leading the company to pivot toward **personalized skincare consulting + merchandise distribution**.

## My Role & Key Contributions

### Business & Strategy
- Founder with full responsibility: business model, branding, product, sales, and marketing
- Business Plan creation (SWOT, model, mission, vision, value proposition)
- Validation of the Colombian market, identification of friction points, and viability analysis
- Data-driven decision making based on market research and customer feedback

### Product Development
- Development of skin diagnostics and personalized routines
- Skincare consulting services design
- End-to-end operational management: suppliers, logistics, customer support

### Digital Marketing
- Website and social media development (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- Content strategy and creation
- Metrics tracking and performance analysis
- Customer acquisition and retention strategies

## Technologies & Tools

- **Digital Platforms**: Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Social Media Insights
- **Tools**: Canva, Notion
- **Methodology**: Lean Startup, Customer Discovery

## Challenges and Learnings

The most valuable learning came from validating that the market was not sufficiently profitable and making the difficult decision to close the company. This experience strengthened my ability to:
- **Analyze real demand** and understand consumer behavior
- **Make data-driven decisions** even when they're difficult
- **Pivot quickly** based on market feedback
- **Apply QA thinking to business validation** - testing assumptions before scaling

## Outcome

Although Ánphora closed after market validation, it provided crucial entrepreneurial experience:
- Understanding the importance of market validation before product development
- Learning to fail fast and extract valuable insights
- Developing resilience and adaptability
- Applying systematic testing methodology to business hypotheses

This experience reinforced my QA philosophy: **validate assumptions early, test rigorously, and make data-driven decisions**—principles I now apply to software quality assurance.
