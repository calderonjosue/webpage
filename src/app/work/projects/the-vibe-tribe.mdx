## Overview

The Vibe Tribe was a startup focused on developing a mobile application for travelers and city residents, offering real-time local experiences and enabling connections within and outside the city.

## My Role & Key Contributions

### Product Strategy
- Conceptual design of the app: cultural research, audience analysis (travelers & locals), definition of core features and social interaction experience
- Development of the complete **Business Plan** (SWOT, value proposition, roadmap, monetization)
- Brand identity creation: Brand Book, Manifesto, tone, and narrative
- Early market validation, risk analysis, and competitor benchmarking in the "experiences" and social-discovery app segment

### Quality Assurance
- Manual UI/UX testing to ensure visual consistency and accessibility
- API testing with Postman to validate data flow between backend and mobile frontend
- Bug tracking and documentation in Jira
- Scrum-based workflow with daily standups and technical reviews
- Shift Left approach for early defect detection

## Technologies & Tools

- **Testing**: Postman, Jira, Confluence
- **Design**: Figma
- **Methodology**: Scrum, Manual QA, API Testing

## Challenges and Learnings

Working on The Vibe Tribe taught me the importance of validating assumptions before scaling an MVP. The project ended due to lack of funding, but it significantly strengthened my Product mindset, early QA skills, and my ability to understand the complete product lifecycle from market validation to launch.

## Outcome

Although the project didn't reach market launch, it provided invaluable experience in:
- Combining QA expertise with product strategy
- Understanding the full product development cycle
- Working in a startup environment with limited resources
- Validating product-market fit through research and testing

This experience shaped my approach to QA—I don't just find bugs; I validate products from a user-centered perspective, ensuring quality aligns with business goals.
