## My Role & Key Contributions

### Business & Strategy
- Full creation of the business model and cultural vision
- Business Plan development: purpose, editorial lines, products, roadmap
- Growth strategy based on **growth marketing, niche audiences, and cultural product positioning**
- Application of QA principles to editorial and digital production processes

### Creative Direction
- Conceptual design of content: language, imagery, symbolism, theory, and aesthetics
- Artistic curation and visual storytelling
- Design System: "Elemental" (semantic color palettes based on themes)
- UX/UI: Mystical-minimalist aesthetic with hierarchical Serif/Sans-serif typography

### Technical Development
- Website development using modern web technologies
- Development of an internal tool using Node.js for editorial content transpilation
- Performance optimization (Lazy loading, Code splitting), achieving a lightweight core bundle (approximately 140kB)

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** + Create React App
- **Framer Motion** for complex scroll/hover animations
- **Tailwind CSS** + clsx + tailwind-merge (Dark mode enabled)

### Blog Engine
- **Astro** (Static Site Generator) for maximum SEO and performance

### DevOps & Integrations
- **GitHub CI/CD** pipeline with automatic deployment on Vercel
- **REST API** connection with Brevo (Email Marketing) and Elfsight (Social Feeds)

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing artistic vision with technical performance and user experience was a unique challenge. I learned to apply QA principles not just to code, but to editorial content, ensuring consistency in tone, aesthetics, and cultural messaging across all touchpoints.

## Outcome

A culturally rich project with strong conceptual grounding, editorial projection, and creative depth. Sagrada Ciencia demonstrates my ability to combine technical expertise with creative direction, applying quality assurance principles across both digital and editorial domains.
